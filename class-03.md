# **LISTs**

## Ordered Lists

* `<ol>`
The ordered list is created with the `<ol>` element.

* `<li>`
Each item in the list is placed between an opening `<li>` tag and a closing `</li>` tag. (The li stands for list item.)



## Unordered Lists

* `<ul>`
The unordered list is created with the `<ul>` element.


* `<li>`
Each item in the list is placed between an opening `<li>` tag and a closing `</li>` tag. (The li stands for list item.)

#### Border, Margin and Padding 

1. Border: Every box has a border (even if it is not visible or is specified to be 0 pixels wide). The border separates
    the edge of one box from another.
    
2. Margin :Margins sit outside the edge of the border. You can set the width of a margin to create a gap between the    borders of two adjacent boxes.

3. Padding :Padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it.
    Adding padding can increase the readability of its contents.
