# Images

## [You can try and figure out any thing related to imges here!!](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images.asp)
You can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS, just like any other box.
In addition to the float property, you can use the align attribute.
Background images can be used using an example like this: body {background-image: url("images/pattern.gif");}
Repeating images can be used with the folowing example: body { background-image: url("images/header.gif"); background-repeat: repeat=x;}
Image rollovers is achieved by setting a background image for the link or button that has three different styles of the same button.
When an single image is used for several different parts of an interface, it is known as a sprite. The advantage of using sprites is that the web browser only needs to request on image rather than many images, which can make the page load faster.(pg.417-418)

* You can specify the dimensions o XX f images using CSS. This is very helpful when you use the same sized images on several pages of your site.
*  Images can be aligned both horizontally and vertically using CSS.
*  You can use a background image behind the box created by any element on a page.
* Background images can appear just once or be repeated across the background of the box.
* You can create image rollover effects by moving the background position of an image.
* To reduce the number of images your browser has to load, you can create image sprites.


- Background Images
The background-image property allows you to place an image behind any HTML element. This could be the entire page or just part of the page. By default, a background image will repeat to fill the entire box.

- background-repeat
The background image is repeated both horizontally and vertically (the default way it is shown if the backgroundrepeat property isn't used).

- Background Position
When an image is not being repeated, you can use the background-position property to specify where in the browser window the background image should be placed.

### How to Identify Keywords and Phrases
1. **Brainstorm** List down the words that someone might type into Google to find your site. Be sure to include the various topics, products or services your site is about.
2. **Organize** Group the keywords into separate lists for the different sections or categories of your website.
3. **Research** There are several tools that let you enter your keywords and then they will suggest additional keywords you might like to consider.
4. **Compare** It is very unlikely that your site will appear at the top of the search results for every
keyword. This is especially true for topics where there is a lot of competition. 
5. **Refine** Now you need to pick which keywords you will focus on. These should always be the ones that are most relevant to each section of your site.
6. **Map** Now that you have a refined list of keywords, you know which have the most competition, and
which ones are most relevant, it is time to start picking which keywords you will use for each page.
