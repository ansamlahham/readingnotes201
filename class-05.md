#### Adding Images

`<img>` To add an image into the page you need to use an `<img>` element. This is an empty
element (which means there is no closing tag). It must carry the following two attributes:

*1. src* :
This tells the browser where
it can find the image file. This
will usually be a relative URL
pointing to an image on your
own site. 

*2. alt*:
This provides a text description
of the image which describes the
image if you cannot see it.

#### Height & Width of Images ####

for example :
`<img src="images/quokka.jpg" alt="A family of
quokka" width="600" height="450" />`

Where to Place Images
in Your Code

1: before a paragraph
The paragraph starts on a new
line after the image.

2: inside the start of a
paragraph
The first row of text aligns with
the bottom of the image.

3: in the middle of a
paragraph
The image is placed between the
words of the paragraph that it
appears in.

Three Rules for
Creating Images:

1.Save images in
the right format

2.Save images at
the right size

3.Use the correct
resolution

colors, it is important to ensure that there is
enough contrast for the text to be legible.

## Text:

Typeface Terminology :

Serif : Serif fonts have extra details on
the ends of the main strokes of
the letters. These details are
known as serifs.

Sans-Serif:Sans-serif fonts have straight
ends to letters, and therefore
have a much cleaner design.

Monospace :Every letter in a monospace (or
fixed-width) font is the same
width. (Non-monospace fonts
have different widths.)

Choosing a Typeface
for your Website

When choosing
a typeface, it
is important to
understand that a
browser will usually
only display it if it's
installed on that
user's computer.
